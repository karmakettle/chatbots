  Nog?  What's going on?&&& Commander, my name is Quark.  I used  to run the local gambling  establishment... this is my brother's  boy... surely you can see that he  only has a peripheral involvement in  all this... we're scheduled to depart  tomorrow...  if we could be permitted  to take him, I promise you he will  be severely...&&&  Not going to leave... But we're all  packed and ready to...&&& Why would you want me to stay?&&& I am not a thief.&&& If I am, you haven't been able to  prove it for four years...&&& Me?  A Community Leader?&&& How could I possibly operate my  establishment under Starfleet rules  of conduct?&&& Commander, I've made a career out of  knowing when to leave.  This Bajoran  provisional government is far too  provisional for my taste.  And when  governments fall, people like me are  lined up and shot...&&& What'll you have, Commander?&&& You won't like it.  I love the Bajorans... such a deeply  spiritual culture... but they make a  dreadful ale.&&& Don't ever trust an ale from a god  fearing people...&&&  ... or a Starfleet Commander who has  one of your relatives in jail.&&& What do you mean?  You can't do this.&&& I intend to.  This is outrageous...  my apologies friends... a minor  misunderstanding that will be  rectified shortly...&&& Give them something to put their  winnings in...&&& New rules... ?&&& Very well.  Very well.  Perhaps we  could discuss these new rules over a  drink...&&& I love a woman in uniform...&&&  Excuse me, but if you're done  scaring my customers away, I'd  like to reopen the bar.&&&  Thank you.   Constable, it just occurred to me  that if I knew in advance how long  it would take them to catch you  during the next drill... Well  let's just say you and I could  split a substantial profit.&&&   Think about it.&&& is behind the counter, surveying his domain with  a frown. A quiet bar is an unprofitable bar.&&&   Listen. Do you hear that?&&&  Exactly. The ambient noise level  in this room is less than thirty  decibels. On an average day it's  sixty-five. When there're  Klingons in the room, it can go as  high as eighty-five.&&&  Too quiet. Something is terribly  wrong.&&&  I don't know. But have you ever  met a quiet Klingon before?    And look at the way they're  watching the room. It's like...  they're picking out targets.&&&   Where are you going?&&& Don't do that.&&&  I don't want them to know we're on  to them.&&&  What are you two doing? I'm  telling you, the Klingons are up  to something.&&&  They might be your allies, but  they're not mine.&&&  Yeah. But will he tell me?&&&  Just what this station needs ... another Klingon.&&& Let me guess, Klingon bloodwine.&&&   Prune juice?&&&   If you say so.&&& Do you hear that, Chief? Seventy-  two decibels. Music to my ears.&&& You want quiet, go to the  Replimat. This is Quark's the way  Quark's should be. The way it was  meant to be.   Am I glad we finally got rid of  all those Klingons.&&& Present company excepted, of  course.&&&   Ah, what do I care? All he ever  drinks is prune juice.&&&  Help yourself. It's on the house.&&& I'm in an uncharacteristic mood.  Besides, I've got eighty cases of this stuff sitting in my  stockroom. And the way things are  going, I'll never unload another  bottle unless it's to you.&&&  I should've listened to my cousin Gaila.  He said to me, "Quark,  I've got one word for you...  weapons." No one ever went broke  selling weapons. But did I take  his advice... No. And why not?  Because I'm a people person. I  like interacting with my  customers. Like you and I are  doing right now. Talking to each  other, getting to know one  another...&&&   But when you're dealing in  weapons, buyers aren't interested  in casual conversation. They just  want their merchandise... no  questions asked. It's so  impersonal.&&&  Exactly. So now Gaila owns his  own moon, and I'm staring into the  abyss.&&&   And the worst part is, my only  hope for salvation... is the  Federation.&&&  Here, I want you to try something  for me.&&&  Take a sip of this.&&&  A human drink. It's called root  beer.&&&  Go ahead. Aren't you just a  little bit curious?&&&  What do you think?&&&  I know.   It's so bubbly and cloying and  happy.&&&  But you know what's really  frightening? If you drink enough  of it, you start to like it.&&&  Just like the Federation.&&&   I hope so.&&& Now what?&&&    The Klingons. First it was the   Cardassians, then it was the   Dominion, and now it's the  Klingons. How's a Ferengi  supposed to make an honest living  in a place like this?&&&  I'm not going to any emergency  shelter. This is my bar. And I'm  going to defend it.&&&  With this.&&&  No, this is my disruptor pistol.  The one I used to carry in the old  days, when I was serving on that  Ferengi freighter.&&&   That's right, and every member   of that crew thought he was a food  critic.   If the Klingons try to get through  these doors, I'll be ready for  them.&&&  I'll kill him.&&& Heard anything from the Defiant?&&& My money says he did. We haven't seen the last of that crazy Klingon.&&& They'll find him. It's just going to take a while. You know what it's like in the Badlands, there's a lot of sensor interference.&&& What would you be able to do that they can't?&&& He'll be back before you know it.&&& Absolutely. The night before he went on patrol, he brought the Koraga's crew in here and bought them three barrels of bloodwine.&&& And he didn't pay the tab. You really think he'd go to Sto'Vo'Kor owing me money?&&& Exactly. He couldn't enjoy the afterlife knowing that I had something over him.&&& You're up early today.&&& But this is a special day, isn't it?&&&  It's a good day to die.&&& But some days are better than others. Like today, for instance. The day the Federation- Klingon-Romulan Alliance launches its invasion of Cardassia. The final push in the long struggle to rid the Alpha Quadrant of the Dominion and save my bar in the process.&&&  He did.&&& Good guess, Morn. Today's the day...&&& Do you have any threes?&&& It's just not my game.&&& How about some tongo?&&& How could they? It's a Ferengi game.&&& I know, I know this place is period specific. For a hologram, you're not very accommodating.&&& I dropped by because I had nothing else to do. My bar hasn't had half a dozen customers all day. Everyone's off fighting this stupid war.&&& They think they have it rough, they should try living my life for a day. The hospitality industry isn't for the faint- hearted.&&& That's right. But few people understand that. They think it's one big, happy party. They forget that the person giving the party never has any fun.       DEEP SPACE NINE:'What You... " - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO      28.&&&  All I do -- all day long -- is give, give, give...&&& You think so?&&& I just hope Nog and the rest of those heroic idiots come back in one piece..&&& I thought you said a bartender's life was a lonely one?&&&  Go fish.&&& Actually, I'm here for the-end-of- the-war-good-bye-Chief-O'Brien- good-bye-Odo-good-bye-Worf-party.&&& I don't see what's so great about it. Earth's nothing more than a rotating ball of boredom. If you ask me, you'd be better off staying right here --  -- and that goes for you two as well.&&& Me? Not a chance. I just don't like change, that's all.&&&  I knew it!&&& When I saw the two of you slip out of the holosuite, I said to myself, "That no-good, misanthropic, cantankerous, changeling is trying to sneak off the station without anyone noticing."&&& Well, it's not going to happen.&&& So now that I'm here... isn't there something you want to say to me?&&& Such as, "Good-bye, you certainly were a worthy adversary" -- or maybe something with the words "mutual respect" in it...&&& No? What do you mean "no?"&&& You're telling me that after all these years... after all we've been through, you're not even going to say good-bye to me?&&& I guess that's it then...&&& Hard? What are you talking about?  That man loves me -- couldn't you see? It was written all over his back.&&& That'll be ten strips of latinum.&&& I know, I know -- I'll put it on your tab.&&& Don't worry, it's guaranteed to grow hair within a week. Though if you ask me, that dome of yours is hairy enough. Besides, hasn't there been enough change around here already?&&& That's this week's betting pool...&&& It's a wide open field. Just between you and me, the smart money's on Vedek Ungtae.&&& What are you talking about?&&&  Fifteen days... can I bring my own pillow?&&& It's clear, it's clear.&&& It's like I said, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
